## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonic-agent-ai.git
cd sonic-agent-ai
````

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
```

### 4. Run Backend

```bash
uv run uvicorn src.api:app --reload
```

---

### 5. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters input (product / idea)
2. Agent detects intent (ad, story, podcast)
3. Script is generated using LLM
4. Script is converted into dialogue
5. Voice is generated for each segment
6. Segments are merged into a single voice track
7. Background music is selected based on mood
8. Final audio is generated and saved
9. History is stored with relative paths

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### POST `/generate-ad`

Generate an audio ad

```json
{
  "product": "Create an ad for my ecommerce store"
}
```

### POST `/agent`

Run full intelligent agent

```json
{
  "input": "Tell a story about space"
}
```

### GET `/history`

Fetch generated history

### DELETE `/history`

Clear history

---

## 📁 Output Format

```json
{
  "script": "...",
  "intent": "ad",
  "audio_file": "/outputs/final/final_xxx.mp3"
}
```

---

## ❗ Error Handling

* Voice generation failure
* API key issues (expired / invalid)
* Missing music files
* System-level failures

Errors are:

* Stored in history
* Displayed in frontend (notification system)
* Do NOT include audio files

---

## 🎨 Frontend Highlights

* Clean modern UI
* Audio preview player
* Download functionality
* Recent history section
* Smart error notifications (no alerts)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* 🔁 Regenerate audio feature
* 🎚️ Voice customization (pitch, speed)
* 🌍 Multi-language support
* ☁️ Cloud storage integration
* 🎛️ Advanced audio controls
* 📊 Analytics dashboard
